    <h1>Class notes</h1>

    <p>
      Over my time at university, I've taken a lot of notes for a lot of classes. I pride myself on
      taking exceptionally neat and well-organized notes, with the intention that they be referenced
      at a later time. It's always been a shame that, when finals are over, my notes just go into
      an archive folder in my closet at home, probably never to be looked at again. Now that I've created
      this website, however, there's a second home for my notes after all! They're sorted below by subject,
      and I can't guarantee that the information in them is absolutely correct. I will say, though, that
      I haven't yet failed a class, so I'd assume a lower bound for factual correctness of my notes to be
      60%. In reality, it's probably more like 95%. And as a disclaimer, not all of the notes I've taken are
      complete (e.g. I think the linear algebra notes drop off halfway through the semester).
