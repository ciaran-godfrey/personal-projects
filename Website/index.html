    <p>
      Welcome to my website! I graduated from Yale in 2020 with a degree in physics. This website serves
      as a digital dumping ground for me; I primarily use it to post my thoughts on various things (in the blog section)
      as well as to document some of the projects that I've worked on. Although I study physics, I do a lot of
      engineering projects that are all loosely related around the theme of robotics. I'm interested in cool
      mechanisms, electronics hacks, and control theory/intelligence stuff. To see what I've worked on,
      check out the <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> page.
