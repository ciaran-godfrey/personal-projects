    <h1>High-level design of lower body</h1>
    <p>The hip joint is the same as the calf and foot joint presented below, but with the ball end
    at the hip instead of at the knee (so upside down). The knee is a simple revolute joint. I'm 99%
    that this design captures all of the DOFs of the human lower body. Some advantages to this design:
    it's buildable (ball joints are readily available); it's easy to add springs to each piston for the
    purpose of adding series compliance to the body. Disadvantages: I'm not sure the range of motion of
    the joints given the limited range of motion of the ball joints that comprise them.</p>

    <h2>Initial design for 3-DOF calf and foot joint</h2>
    <p>The foot section (lower circular plate) can move in 3 ways: rotation about the central axis
    of the calf, tilt left to right, and tilt forwards and backwards.</p>
